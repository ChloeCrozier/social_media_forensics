# Social Media Analysis with Python
This project focuses on analyzing social media data using Python to identify coordinated and inauthentic attacks. It includes a feature to detect potential sock-puppet based attacks on Wikipedia by leveraging information collected from Pywikibot

Below are WordClouds of common words added or removed during an edit. These were used to identify similar content strategies among suspected sock-puppet accounts. Additionally, there is a graph of the time of edit within a specific Wikipedia page and the type of device used to make the edit. This was used to check if edits from different accounts showed similar activity patterns.
